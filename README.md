## The Bird Watching Checklist
### Chirp Check is a light-weight checklist app that allows you to track how many birds you see at a given location. Whether you're out on a hike, down by the shore or working in the garden at home, this app is there for you!

The responsive website app allows registered users to log in and create new checklists, or update an existing one with birds they have or have not seen.

This project has been created as the final portfolio project for Code Institute's 16 week fullstack developer bootcamp.  

Built by Emma Sadler.

# UX

## Database Planning

I started with the knowledge I would have 3 core components to my app: The User, the Checklist and Birds. I then wrote down a relationship diagram, exploring how these would work together. I also consulting with my Subject Matter Expert tutor Kevin Loughrey on what would and would not be necessary for each model in order to keep it as streamlined as possible.

## UX Design

### Overview
Provide a brief overview of the UX design and user experience goals.

### Site User
This app is designed for use by students, casual bird lovers, and more active watchers. 

### Goal
This app is for bird watchers. It is designed to make simple checklists with a name and location that can be easily edited. The user can then freely add and delete birds to their checklist, as well as indicate if a specific bird was seen or not, and how many were seen if they were. This is laid out clearly and without clutter.

# Agile Development

Using Miroboard, I first iterated on the bird watching app, its use cases and what would be needed for such an app.

![Miroboard Planning Part 1](doc/cc_iteration01.png)

I then pared this down to its most simple form, to ensure that key CRUD functionality could be obtained at the minimum viable product level.

Once I started the Chirp Check app in earnest, I made a [project board](https://github.com/users/SummonerSkies/projects/4) on GitHub's Project site.
