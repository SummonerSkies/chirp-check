# Welcome to Chirp Check!

## The Bird Watching Checklist
### Chirp Check is a light-weight checklist app that allows you to track how many birds you see at a given location. Whether you're out on a hike, down by the shore or working in the garden at home, this app is there for you!

The responsive website app allows registered users to log in and create new checklists, or update an existing one with birds they have or have not seen.

## UX Design

### Overview
Provide a brief overview of the UX design and user experience goals.

### Site User
This app is designed for use by students, casual bird lovers, and more active watchers. 

### Goal
This app is for bird watchers. It is designed to make simple checklists with a name and location that can be easily edited. The user can then freely add and delete birds to their checklist, as well as indicate if a specific bird was seen or not, and how many were seen if they were. This is laid out clearly and without clutter.
